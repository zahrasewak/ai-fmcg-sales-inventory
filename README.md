# Smart Sales & Inventory Brain (FMCG – Asian Paints)

## Overview
Smart Sales & Inventory Brain is an AI-powered decision intelligence platform designed for the FMCG sector, with a focus on paints and coatings. The solution helps organizations improve demand forecasting, inventory planning, and business decision-making by transforming raw data into actionable insights.

The platform is built as part of the EY Techathon and demonstrates how AI, analytics, and modern dashboards can solve real-world supply chain and sales challenges.

 Problem Statement
FMCG companies face multiple operational challenges such as:
- Inaccurate demand forecasting across regions
- Stockouts and excess inventory (deadstock)
- Lack of real-time visibility into inventory health
- Delayed and manual decision-making
- Difficulty in converting data into actionable insights

These issues lead to increased costs, lost revenue, and inefficient operations.

 Proposed Solution
The Smart Sales & Inventory Brain addresses these challenges through:
- AI-based demand forecasting at SKU and regional level
- Inventory health monitoring including ageing and shelf-life risks
- Geo heatmaps to visualize regional demand and supply gaps
- Automated alerts and recommendations for faster actions
- A conversational AI assistant to query insights in natural language

The system moves beyond static dashboards to proactive, insight-driven decision support.
